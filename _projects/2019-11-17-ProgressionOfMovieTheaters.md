The first ever ITMF demonstration created by Dell Wolfenspager and I for show during the 2019 Light Field and Holographic Display Summit at CableLabs in early October 2019. We composed three scenes from pre-built 3D models: a 1920s silent cinema, a mid-century drive-in theater, and a modern day home theater. These scenes were showcased on an Oculus Go, 2D/3D TVs, and a Looking Glass.
