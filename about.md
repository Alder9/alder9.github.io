<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/avatar.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Proactive, design centered developer and content creator motivated to create beautiful and immersive applications with a hunger to increase knowledge in well-designed user experiences and professional development of 3D apps mainly in VR/AR. Current Computer Science senior entering his final semester at the University of Colorado â€“ Boulder.

### Education

Currently completing Computer Science BS at University of Colorado - Boulder. Graduating 2020.

### Roles

#### Computer Graphics Intern, CableLabs, 05/19-10/19

* Helped in the development of a specification regarding the standardization of 3D volumetric assets. Fact checked as well as developed appendixes regarding animation and Lua audio scripts.
* Provided a greater understanding of VR/AR, 3D formats and concepts such as FBX, ORBX, rendering, and raytracing.
* Working on a collaborative demonstration with Charter for a specification for a Display Summit being held at CableLabs in early October 2019. The demo revolves around the idea of the progression of movie theaters over time. Leveraging pre-made 3D content, I brought the assets into Blender for clean-up and rendered them through a physically based renderer, Octane Renderer, to achieve photorealism in a synthetic 3D scene for use on multiple displays including 3DoF/6DoF VR. Work also included animating humanoid figures and lighting to create an alive, and visually stimulating environment.
* Gained exposure to workflows involving numerous, large companies by sitting and participating in remote and in-person working group meetings.

#### Video Editing/3D Modelling Intern and Software Intern, Reality Garage, 08/17-01/18 and 05/18-09/18

* 3D scanned people, cleaned up resultant model with ZBrush before animating through Adobe Mixamo and Unity developing a workflow of integrating representations of people in VR.
* Designed and developed a VR casting system using UDP between the Android based Oculus Go and Windows computer within Unity/C# successfully collaborating with a fellow intern.
* Built an accompanying admin web application using Express and NodeJS acting as a control page for numerous VR kiosks in museums and businesses. Working alongside another intern, we used HTTP requests from a Unity-based C# client to communicate with a NodeJS server on AWS continuously exchanging JSONs with updated information regarding the kiosks.
* Spent time within their VR arcade as a VR guide helping people from numerous backgrounds understand and experience VR.
